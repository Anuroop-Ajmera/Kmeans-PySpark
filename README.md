# Kmeans-PySpark

a. You are given a file called points.txt. Each line contains information for a point: its two coordinates separated by a tab.
b. Run KMeans with K=3. The centroids should be initialized as (2,5), (6,2), (1,1).
c. The output format should be as follows: Every line should correspond to one cluster centroid. It should be in this format.
PointCoordinate1#PointCoordinate2 e.g., 4.738#1.745
